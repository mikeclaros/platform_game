###### Short Description:
This project is written in C++ using<BR>
the SFML library. The games itself is<BR>
a clone of the squid jump mini-game from<BR>
Splatoon.

The base of the project was made by following<BR> 
http://www.gamefromscratch.com/ SFML C++ tutorial<BR> 

From there I built on top of that tutorial<BR> 
to make this game.<BR> 

There are still many things I want to add on to<BR> 
this project, but for now it is a working base<BR> 
of something. I will be adding things to it from<BR> 
time to time.<BR>

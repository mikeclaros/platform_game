This project is written in C++ using
the SFML library. The games itself is
a clone of the squid jump mini-game from
Splatoon.

The base of the project was made by following 
http://www.gamefromscratch.com/ SFML C++ tutorial

From there I built on top of that tutorial
to make this game.

There are still many things I want to add on to
this project, but for now it is a working base
of something. I will be adding things to it from
time to time.
